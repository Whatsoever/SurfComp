Solution
# Concentrations which are supposed to be mol/L
H2O 	55.5555556		# Maybe define in other form or even not define, must be discussed --> Since Craig impose already this concentration value
H+	2.5763e-08		# Actually pH = -log(ah+),  so if pH is given no H+ need, and also what would be given would be ah, not concentration of the basis, must be discussed
				# Phreeqc does charge balance to pH = 7.589 --> approx. 2.5763e-08 mol/L
Na+	1e-3
Cl-	1e-3
Pb+2	1e-4
SO4-2	1e-4

Sorption
# Name of the primary surface ('Surface_component')	# mols or (mols/L) T_solid 	# Specific_surface_area [m^2/g]		# grams [g]/ solid concentration [g/l]
# Units must still be decided or be assured by the user that they have sense
