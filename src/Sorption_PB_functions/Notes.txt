four_layer_model is not stable due to negative values that can arise in the internal solver of scipy.

four_layer_model_2try is like four_layer_model but with a Newton-Raphson and underrelaxation technique
although it is not extremely stable, it tend to converge, at least for the flm test, but the tolerance is not
extremely high.

four_layer_model_LNX is like four_layer_model but with a natural log formulation it seems 
to be the more stable option. The tolerance of convergence is a factor of 10 or 100 decimal better.
