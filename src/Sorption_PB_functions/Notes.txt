0) "bvp" is the boundary value problem solver of scipy. It has been modified to accept arrays.

1) "four_layer_model.py" is not stable due to negative values that can arise in the internal solver of scipy.

2) "four_layer_model_2try.py" is like "four_layer_model.py" but with a Newton-Raphson and underrelaxation technique.

3) "four_layer_model_LNX.py" is like "four_layer_model_2try.py" but with a natural log formulation it is more stable option. 

4) "four_layer_model_2try_withFixSpeciesOption.py" is like "four_layer_model_2try.py" but with an option to fix the value of aqueuous primary species

5) "four_layer_model_2try_withFixSpeciesOption_Scaling.py" is like "four_layer_model_2try_withFixSpeciesOption.py" but includes a scaling matrix approach

6) "four_layer_model_LNX_withFixSpeciesOption.py" is like "four_layer_model_2try_withFixSpeciesOption.py" but with a natural log formulation it is more stable option.

7) "four_layer_model_LNX_withFixSpeciesOption_Scaling.py" is like "four_layer_model_2try_withFixSpeciesOption_Scaling.py" but with a natural log formulation it is more stable option.

[from 1) to 7) are all models with only one surface]

8) "four_layer_model_2try_withFixSpeciesOption_Scaling_2surface.py" --> It is like "four_layer_model_2try_withFixSpeciesOption_Scaling.py" but with an extra surface.
   The extra surface is equal to the other surface, but is so far that the poisson boltzman is at infinity.

9) "four_layer_model_LNX_withFixSpeciesOption_Scaling_2surface.py" it is like "four_layer_model_2try_withFixSpeciesOption_Scaling_2surface.py"

10) "PB_coup_four_layer_2try.py" is the numerical implementation
